Specifications are descriptions of work we are doing or plan to do. They may vary in degree of specificity and the actual code may sometimes deviate from the spec as work progresses, without necessarily going back to change the spec. When the work is done, the spec is removed from the wiki or incorporated into a tech note as needed.

* **Reviewing** means the spec is finished and is under review.
* **Complete** means the spec is complete and has been reviewed.
* **Implementing** means the spec is complete and the code is being worked on.
* **Implemented** means the code has been written and merged.
