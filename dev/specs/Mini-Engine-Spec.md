##Under Construction

The notion of a mini-engine has come up in several separate contexts, in particular in relation to the Visual Studio adapter and the compact framework build.

Our current engine does a lot of things and not all of them make sense when used by a special-purpose runner or in a device. In addition, some features are not used when the engine is used in an nunit-agent process.

See [[Test Engine]] for a table showing a high-level view of the features of the mini-engine.
