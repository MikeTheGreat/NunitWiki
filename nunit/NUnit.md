###NUnit 3.2 Documentation

This documentation covers the NUnit 3.2 release, 
introducing a large set of new features to NUnit, particularly in
the area of parameterized or data-driven testing.

Where applicable, we have marked sections with the version in which a feature 
first appeared.

If you are new to NUnit, we suggest you begin by reading the 
**Getting Started** section of this site.
Those who have used earlier releases may want to begin with the 
[[Upgrading]] section.

See the [[Release Notes]] for more information on this release.
